# davidtrussler.net

This is my website. 

It is a  much simplified version of the previous incarnation, consisting of a single page. 

It is built in plain HTML/CSS/JS

It uses SASS as a CSS preprocessor

## Prerequisites
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## To clone and set up the project locally:
- `git clone https://github.com/davidtrussler/david-trussler-net.git`
- `cd david-trussler-net`

## Set up sass to compile the sass to css: 
- `sass source/stylesheets/app.scss stylesheets/app.css`
- `sass --watch source/stylesheets/app.scss:stylesheets/app.css`
