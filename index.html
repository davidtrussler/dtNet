					<p>I am a Frontend Web Developer based in Coventry and London. I&#8217;m also a runner of half and full marathons, an occasional musician (improvised reeds and electronics), a supporter of the football teams of Coventry City and Wales and a sometime commentator on politics.</p>

					<p>I have been working in web development for several years after emerging from the print industry, both in design and in the actual process of applying ink to paper. With this background, it&#8217;s no surprise that I am a bit obsessed with good, old-fashioned values of typography and find bringing this into the digital age a fascinating challenge.</p>

					<p>I have extensive experience of all aspects of Front End Web Development and consider myself a dedicated team member, committed to producing work of the highest standards within tight deadlines. I have a good appreciation of visual design and a creative and innovative approach to problem-solving.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m an enthusiastic advocate of responsive design and a mobile-first approach and have a good understanding of the concepts of object oriented development, progressive enhancement, accessibility and cross-browser compatibility. I&#8217;m very enthusiastic about looking for ways to enhance the user experience, and to pro-actively incorporate new ideas and practices in web development.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m keen to use modern technology to help online users enrich and better their lives with well-designed tools and accessible information. I&#8217;m passionate about being involved at every stage of the process, collaborating with a wide range of other team members to solve problems and push for the most effective way to achieve results.</p>
