One is the forthcoming trial of Chelsea&#8217;s John Terry on charges of racially abusing an opponent. The other is the similar incident involving Luis Su&#225;rez and Patrice Evra of Liverpool and Manchester United respectively.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The first of these became even more significant when it apparently forced the resignation of the coach of the English national team, Fabio Capello, over the decision of the FA to strip Terry of the captaincy pending his trial. The latter incident became even more highly-charged yesterday when, only a few days after Su&#225;rez completed an eight-match ban for the incident, Liverpool and Manchester United met in a League match and Su&#225;rez refused the customary pre-match handshake with Evra. This brought harsh words from United manager Alex Ferguson, who went on to suggest that Liverpool Football Club have a particular problem with racism. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish on the other hand continued to support his player.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[As a football club, Liverpool certainly have a case to answer. The insistence, by Dalglish in particular, that Su&#225;rez remained innocent throughout all the proceedings was shameful and made the situation worse. The response of the club has continued to be one of playing the victim. When the squad and manager emerged pre-match in t-shirts proclaiming their support for the player shortly after the ban was imposed one&#8217;s heart could only sink with the recognition that the club just didn&#8217;t get it. Their actions have done much to ensure that racism has been shown to be alive within football despite the efforts of many and the very real progress the game has made over the last couple of decades.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[For me, and this appeared to be what Ferguson had in mind when he spoke of the history of racism in Liverpool, my mind went back some twenty three years and the publication of &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsc.co.uk/component/page,shop.product_details/flypage,shop.flypage/product_id,47/category_id,9/manufacturer_id,0/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,67/&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;Out of His Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, by Dave Hill. This fine book, republished by WSC Books in 2001, described the arrival of John Barnes at Anfield and cleverly interwove this with Barnes&#8217; relatively privileged upbringing, the history of Liverpool as a port with its connections to the slave trade and the city&#8217;s accompanying racism, which manifested itself in two clubs&#8212;Everton as well as Liverpool&#8212;who were always painfully slow to accept black players as part of the modern game. The significance, at the time, of Liverpool signing a black player (though Barnes was not in fact the first) is hard to imagine today. The books tells of Liverpool fans going to games at Goodison Park rather than watch their team field a black player. And the cover shows Barnes deftly back-heeling a banana from the pitch which had been thrown at him from the crowd.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The book caused quite some unease at Liverpool Football Club on its publication. Quotes from Kop hero Tommy Smith which appeared in the book particularly illustrate the problem. In an interview he gave to Hill, his casual racism was shocking and, in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/1123/38/&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;introduction to the new edition&lt;/a&gt;, Hill describes how both Smith and Liverpool chairman at the time Peter Robinson responded. Smith threatened legal action, whilst remaining bewildered as to what he had actually done wrong, whilst Robinson declined to speak to him saying &#8220;when someone throws a brick through your window, you don&#8217;t invite them in for a cup of tea&#8221;.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[It is alarming how, despite the giant strides that have been made since, the Su&#225;rez incident suggest some of the fundamental problems remain. The parallels with Dalglish today are uneasy to say the least. The siege mentality that has sprung up at the club, their insistence on themselves and their player as being the victim in the whole affair and, above all, their seeming to remain unaware that they have done anything wrong make uncomfortable parallels with those far off, shameful days.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Never has there been a more appropriate time for that book to be re-read.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\n'),

Called &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;The Sun on Sunday&lt;/span&gt; it is, depending on your point of view, a Sunday version of Britain&#8217;s favourite daily or the now defunct &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;News of the World&lt;/span&gt; under a different name. Featuring columnists as wide-ranging as Katie Price, Nancy Dell&#8217;Olio and Toby Young it&#8217;s clearly a mix of celebrity-obsessed trivia and right-wing tub-thumping. Even the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, has signed up and his truly bizarre first column (reproduced on his own &lt;a class=&quot;newWindow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.archbishopofyork.org/articles.php/2366/celebrating-new-beginnings&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) is as close as you&#8217;ll get to God himself giving the project the thumbs up.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Needless to say, a paper from the News International stable, released just seven months after the closure of the &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;News of the World&lt;/span&gt; following the disclosure of its phone-hacking activities, was always going to draw opposition. And so it has. People have pledged not to buy it for a number of reasons. Because &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;The Sun&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;News of the World&lt;/span&gt; between them have trivialised our media with an obsession with celebrity culture, because of the phone-hacking scandal&#8212;particularly that concerning Millie Dowler&#8212;or because of the power of these papers which has reached far into successive UK governments. In Liverpool &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;The Sun&lt;/span&gt;&#8217;s reporting after the Hillsborough disaster has ensured that it retains the enmity of those who lost loved ones on that day.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[For me it&#8217;s a bit more personal. Twenty six years ago Rupert Murdoch moved the production of four British newspaper titles&#8212;&lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;The Sun&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;News of the World&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/span&gt;&#8212;into a purpose-built plant at Wapping, East London. As part of the move he sacked 6,000 printers, journalists and other staff and employed non-union labour to replace them, largely helped by the electricians union, EEPTU, led by Eric Hammond in a move that would see them thrown out of the TUC.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I was just starting work in the print industry and was a member of the National Graphical Association (NGA). This union, together with SOGAT and the NUJ, led the protests against Murdoch. This dispute, following the miners&#8217; strike a couple of years before, had a significance outside the print industry. It was all part of the agenda of the Thatcher government to roll back the influence of the trade unions from British industry&#8212;an ideological battle that for me was a fundamental attack on core beliefs.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I participated in protests outside the plant a few times but it was clear that this was an operation planned with military precision and, with the assistance of Her Majesty&#8217;s Constabulary, there was only going to be one winner. And, after a year, so it proved as Murdoch emerged victorious. The new plant was built like a fortress, surrounded by razor wire and the surrounding streets were used as a maze from which lorries would periodically emerge into streets cleared by the police bearing the provocative slogan &#8221;&lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;The Sun&lt;/span&gt; keeps on trucking&#8221;. That&#8217;s the thing about people like Murdoch: not only was he carrying out Thatcher&#8217;s agenda, he just had to rub your nose in it as well.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Of course there have been industrial disputes before and since and a temporary boycott of this or that product seems to be part of my daily life. But this one just won&#8217;t go away. Logically I tell myself to let it go but I still shudder when I see someone buying one of those titles. And to make matters worse, Murdoch has continued his grip on our cultural life with his ownership of Sky, and through that the slow strangulation, in my view, of English football. There can be very few people in the UK that don&#8217;t put a little bit of money into this man&#8217;s pocket.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[So, should I let this go? Probably. But Murdoch has a unique place in my personal rogues&#8217; gallery. And a world that is prepared to allow someone like him to have so much influence and control over so much of peoples&#8217; lives is a world that has a long way to go.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\n'),

Well not quite perhaps, but it is now a little over two years since the term was coined by Ethan Marcotte in an article on the blog &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;A List Apart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This article was later expanded into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, published by A Book Apart in July last year, since when the idea has spread rapidly amongst designers and developers and I for one have become an enthusiast.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[In this post I want to put the concept of Responsive Web Design into context&#8212;how and why it has become such a big issue over the last couple of years, explain briefly what it is and how it is achieved and finally discuss some of the criticisms that have been made of it, and why I believe these tend to fundamentally misunderstand the concept.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The main driving force behind the development of the approach has been the increased use of smaller, mobile devices to view online content over the last few years. It is commonly estimated that somewhere around the year of 2014 the use of mobile devices will outstrip desktop devices for viewing online content.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Initially, the main option for developers was to build a dedicated mobile site. The main drawback to this is that it requires the user to be redirected once their device has been recognised and with the number of available mobile devices increasing at a phenomenal rate it is just impossible to keep up. Not only that but the range of different screen sizes and capabilities of these devices is increasing in a wholly unpredictable way.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[It is this dilemma which inspired Marcotte to propose the solution of a site which responds to the device on which it is being viewed in a way that makes sense on that device. There are a number of examples of this&#8212;but probably the first major site to use it was the &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bostonglobe.com/&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Looking at this on a desktop and mobile browser illustrates how the same content can be maximised for the device being used to view it.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[This is made possible by coding the site within a flexible grid, able to respond to the dimensions of the viewport of the device, and using media queries&#8212;new to the W3C CSS3 specification&#8212;to dynamically trigger changes to the layout based upon various attributes of the display device, such as its width, orientation or aspect ratio.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[But more importantly, to me at least, is the philosophy behind this approach. In the article and the book Ethan Marcotte is not just presenting a &#8216;how to&#8217; but is also positing a change in our way of thinking about the web. In this, his starting point is an article by John Allsopp, &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dao/&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;A Dao of Web Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which appeared on &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;A List Apart&lt;/span&gt; some ten years earlier.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The main point Marcotte takes from this is that developments from one media to another inevitably see some elements of the old carried on into the new, even after they have ceased to make sense. This can be best understood by considering parallel developments in other media such as how theatre gave rise to cinema. In its early days films were essentially made by placing a camera in front of actors in a theatrical setting. As the medium evolved&#8212;both through technical advances, and through its own language becoming better understood&#8212;it gradually created its own ways of doing things, casting off the redundant values of its ancestor.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[When applied to web, this refers to how this medium has developed out of print and borrows from it notions such as a clearly defined space&#8212;the printed page&#8212;in which to work and others, such as &#8216;masthead&#8217;, &#8216;white-space&#8217;, &#8216;leading&#8217; and &#8216;fold&#8217;. All of this must be jettisoned in favour of web defining its own rules; what have been seen hitherto as &#8216;limitations&#8217; of the web, as against print, should instead be seen as strengths.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[So to the criticisms. I&#8217;ll cover some of the main ones I have come across here, which all have a certain degree of validity, but for me all miss the essential point.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Broadly speaking, there are three main strands of criticism that I have noticed. The first of these argue that Responsive Design is not as good as a dedicated mobile site because it is difficult to optimise certain elements (especially images) for an unknown device. This is an important point when considering the potentially limited bandwidth available to mobile devices and the image-heavy nature of many desktop sites. Whilst there are discussions around how to better mark up images in HTML&#8212;including suggestions to introduce a &#8216;picture&#8217; tag along the lines of &#8216;video&#8217; and &#8216;audio&#8217; ones&#8212;it remains the case that there is no easy way to serve up smaller images to mobile devices in a responsive site.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Another is that the approach mixes the concepts of the device and the context in which it is used. In other words it is not just about screen sizes but how and when people use the device. Think of a restaurant site for instance. At home your concern may be to find a good restaurant for an evening out. Detailed descriptions of menus and so on will be more appropriate than when you are on the move and your needs are more basic: where is it? Is it open? What&#8217;s the phone number? A dedicated mobile site, it is argued, is more able to serve up aspects of the content appropriate to the context in which it is viewed.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[It is also argued that a responsive approach can have a negative impact on the user experience when elements move from one place to another, less familiar one. This is, to my mind, the most convincing argument against a responsive approach&#8212;though not one that is unique to it: a dedicated mobile site is subject to similar criticisms.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Valid criticisms all. But they serve to highlight the way that the rise of the mobile device has thrown the whole game wide open. Of course large images should not clog up a user&#8217;s bandwidth on a mobile device, but look again at the &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/span&gt; site, preferably on a desktop browser and change the size of the viewport. Image sizes do not change that much between a large or small sized browser window. The design, created with the mobile device foremost in mind, does not call for large images. If your design calls out for large images then the responsive route is not for you. But maybe all sites should move away from this and designers should be encouraged to come up with design solutions rather than rely on technical ones.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The argument over context versus content can be viewed in a similar light. The use of a mobile device does not necessarily imply the user is away from their desktop computer&#8212;browsing on a mobile whilst at home is increasingly common. In other words changing the content for different devices is the wrong approach&#8212;changing how that content is presented is a better one.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Responsive Web Design is, to my mind, primarily about adopting a different philosophy to the development of sites&#8212;beginning with mobile devices&#8212;which should lead to the adoption of better practices on all devices. The mobile-enabled world into which we are now moving presents us with challenges for sure but, armed with a clear idea of how to approach these, and with good concepts of user-oriented design these are challenges we should relish. It is early days for the responsive approach but we as developers have the opportunity to break the chains binding us to the practices of yesterday and take a step towards declaring the web as its own medium. And that&#8217;s quite a revolutionary idea!]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\n'),

Over that time I have become increasingly dismayed at the way this has proceeded, and in particular how the British left has been split down the middle over the issue. I have been angry too at how the level of debate has sunk so low. I find it hard to remember an issue that has proved so divisive, and that has driven journalists and writers whose work I otherwise respect to contribute such poor analysis and resort so easily to name-calling&#8212;and I&#8217;ve been around a bit.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[When talking of Assange supporters or critics we clearly need to be aware that each of these broad categories covers a wide range of opinion. Nonetheless his supporters generally have in common the claim that he would be in grave danger if he were to be extradited to the USA on charges relating to WikiLeaks&#8217; activities, and that such an extradition would be the likely outcome of his being returned first to Sweden to face allegations of rape so this must be avoided at all costs. His critics meanwhile have grasped the tendency of some of their opponents to downplay the rape accusations in one way or another and to appeal to the existing laws of Sweden and the UK to prove that he must return to Sweden. This they do with a mixture of complacency and lack of interest in the possibility that the USA may also become involved. Sadly it doesn&#8217;t rise much above that.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[What has probably angered me most in the debate has been the way two principles have been counter-posed: as if we are being forced by this issue to choose which trumps which&#8212;women&#8217;s rights or freedom of speech. From where I am though it seems pretty clear. Assange should be protected from the probable attempts by the USA to extradite him. For me there is no doubt that they would like to use him through something akin to a show-trial to demonstrate what happens to those who reveal the truth about their actions in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. If this were to be allowed to happen it would be a massive blow against the principle of free speech and it must be resisted. Does that mean we should be happy to see him escape the allegations in Sweden? Definitely not. They are very serious and he must be made to answer them, whether that happens by Sweden undertaking to resist US extradition requests or the legal process happening, partially at least, in a third country. Anyone who supports the principles of free speech and women&#8217;s rights should unite to ensure that both of these come to pass.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[So just why are so many convinced that they are being forced into making this choice? It seems to  be the result of three combined factors which together create a poisonous climate in which a proper debate cannot take place.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The first of these is the specific allegations made in Sweden. The sexual nature of these is guaranteed to drive a wedge between campaigners. It has also allowed a climate of misogyny to enter the debate as many of Assange&#8217;s defenders try to minimise the seriousness of these and has led in turn to the accusation from many of his critics that pretty much everyone who defends him from possible US intervention, irrespective of the merit of their arguments, is a rape apologist.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The second factor is the personalisation of the issue around Assange himself. The sneering at the balcony appearance and other various judgements on his character have no place in this debate. They are irrelevant. This isn&#8217;t centrally about Julian Assange. This is about two central principles. If we get it right in this case the fight for both of those principles could be massively strengthened. Get it wrong&#8212;and that&#8217;s where we are heading right now&#8212;and one, or more likely both, will be weakened.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Finally I have been angered by the way that so much of the so-called debate has been conducted on the basis of existing law. Liberal lawyer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DavidAllenGreen&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;David Allen Green&lt;/a&gt; has become the spokesperson for this tendency through his recent &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;New Statesman&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/08/five-legal-myths-about-assange-extradition&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and this has been dutifully quoted from numerous times to conclude that the existing law can be the only arbiter of what happens. But this misses the crucial point that the law remains in the last resort not a neutral force, standing above politics, but a tool for the maintenance of existing power structures. No-one who has been involved in an industrial dispute can deny this. But this week I have been witnessed otherwise respectable figures on the left stagger up to the insurmountable barrier of the law over whether Swedish police could come to the UK to interview Assange. Or whether Sweden would extradite him anyway. The otherwise brilliant journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OwenJones84&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;Owen Jones&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/owen-jones-there-should-be-no-immunity-for-julian-assange-from-these-allegations-8053869.html&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;The Independent&lt;/span&gt;, while correctly demanding that Assange stands trial is particularly complacent on these points.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The combination of these three factors has led the British left down a total blind alley, where spiteful name-calling has replaced genuine debate. My plea now is for all who want to see justice served wise up and help see this through to a progressive end. This impasse could be solved if the political will was there and people who want to see justice served for Assange&#8217;s alleged victims whilst maintaining the right of freedom of speech stood up together and demanded it.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\n'),

For the uninitiated the simple version of a highly complex set of circumstances goes like this.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The football club and the stadium, built eight years ago for the express purpose of staging the club&#8217;s games, have different owners. And they don&#8217;t like each other: even more so since the club stopped paying the rent and finally bunked off to play in Northampton.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The fans don&#8217;t much care for the club&#8217;s owners either after a so-far five year tenure that has seen a Championship club with ambitions of a return to the Premier League exit that division at the other end. Add to that the fact that they are now required to make a 70 mile round trip to watch their local side play their &#8220;home&#8221; games, and little wonder so many of them are staging a boycott of matches played at their temporary abode.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Now I do love a good boycott. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Apartheid_Movement&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;South African produce during the apartheid era&lt;/a&gt; was a no-brainer. Since 1986 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_dispute&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;News International&#8217;s move to Wapping&lt;/a&gt; any &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidtrussler.net/blog/why-i-wont-be-buying-the-sun-on-sunday-2/&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;product associated with Rupert Murdoch has been a no-go&lt;/a&gt;.

I never watched Neighbours again after the entire cast gleefully scabbed on the strike precipitated by Mrs Mangle&#8217;s sacking. And on it goes.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I even refused to renew my season ticket at Highfield Road and attend the first game of the season after Eric Black was sacked. That&#8217;s just the rebel I am. So boycotting games in Northampton? Also a no-brainer, right?]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[No, wrong actually. Thing is, there are boycotts: an organised campaign carried out by as many as possible to achieve a clearly-defined and achievable end, and boycotts: it kind of feels the right thing to do. I&#8217;ll leave you to judge which of my own litany of refusenikism is in which category but, after extensive research&#8212;well, a lot of time on Twitter&#8212;I&#8217;ve concluded most boycott-minded Coventry City fans fall into the latter category.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[And what&#8217;s wrong with that? Well, nothing. For the boycotter, the action is the thing. But in this particular instance I feel strongly that not only are they wrong to believe this action will achieve an end&#8212;the return of the football club to the City in which it belongs&#8212;but that it is actually proving damaging to the very club it is supposed to save through the reduction in match day revenue and the demoralising effect it must be having on the players&#8212;not that they&#8217;ve shown much evidence of that so far.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I have a further problem with this action. It is becoming increasingly widely accepted that the owners of the stadium (and ultimately this is essentially the City Council via the holding company ACL) are not an entirely innocent party. And yet the boycott targets one side in this dispute, and one side only. Often known under its slogan &#8220;Not One Penny More&#8221;, the campaign and its main spokespeople leave no doubt where they feel the blame lies: with Sisu, the owners of the football club.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[So much for what&#8217;s wrong with the campaign, but what should we be doing?]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I would look to other clubs that have been in a similar situation, particularly Swansea and Portsmouth. Both are now owned by their supporters and that is where I believe the future of football lies. Fans, not only at Coventry City, commonly call for the return of &#8220;their&#8221; club from owners who have no real emotional investment in that club, merely a tawdry financial one. But football clubs have never belonged to the supporters, not in a real sense. Of course football, like much else in life, was once less cynical and some clubs were owned by people who really did care: arguably Jack Walker at Blackburn was the last of this breed, before English football sold its soul to Rupert Murdoch.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Is fan ownership possible at Coventry City? Absolutely. But it won&#8217;t happen tomorrow&#8212;this is a long haul. In the meantime we need to accept that the current owners are going nowhere. The fans&#8217; main representative body, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheSkyBlueTrust&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;Sky Blue Trust&lt;/a&gt;, needs to drop its hostilities towards the owners and work towards gaining representation at boardroom level as a first step towards running things. In the meantime they can help hold the owners to their promise&#8212;at the moment a return to the &#8220;Coventry area&#8221;&#8212;or better still convince them of the need to return to the city itself.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[At the same time pressure must be brought on other parties&#8212;primarily the city council, but also the Football League whose role in all of this has been shameful&#8212;to bring this sorry saga to a happy conclusion. The Trust can play a vital role in brokering deals. And when the time is right, when Sisu want to sell, the true fans will be in place, ready to take the club off their hands.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[In the meantime no-one&#8217;s really happy, me as little as anyone. Feeling unable to support the boycott, but equally feeling like attending a match would be like scabbing, I&#8217;ve taken to going on long runs during matches, the drama at Sixfields conveyed to me through headphones by Stuart, Clive and Geoff. Not being there doesn&#8217;t break my heart, it hasn&#8217;t killed me&#8212;football most certainly is &lt;span class=&quot;strong&quot;&gt;less&lt;/span&gt; important than life and death&#8212;but it would make me a tad moody and irritable to be with on a Saturday, I mean Sunday, afternoon if I was confined to the house.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[So, as I prepare set off on another run I&#8217;m hopeful of another hatful of goals and a scintillating performance, regretful that I&#8217;m not there to see it, but hopeful before long to be back watching my team in its rightful home.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\n'),

As such it should be read alongside that account which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rq9odq&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;For those with a keen sense of the inviolability of historical record I have, in this version, added one paragraph to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evernote.com/shard/s336/sh/d59bcf5b-0bf5-4186-b5da-c5e2c4cedd5b/080d6816663294a30b710d41e6445c4e&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt; dealing with the concept of the Ricoh Arena as a &#8220;white elephant&#8221; and corrected one minor spelling mistake.&lt;/span&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I don&#8217;t disagree with your general conclusions on the shared responsibility for the current plight of the club or your assessment of Sisu&#8217;s aim: to get ownership of the stadium as cheaply as possible. Whether that has always been their aim is open to doubt as is, more importantly, whether that is good or bad for the club and for the city as a whole. I think that could go either way but that is why it is critical that supporters&#8217; groups play it right and get as much influence as they can now and move towards potential eventual ownership. In this respect, by the way, I believe the Sky Blue Trust to be evolving into a hugely credible and important body.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[In terms of accuracy I think you need to be clearer firstly when Sisu took over and acknowledge more clearly that they inherited a totally unsustainable situation, not entirely of their own making and secondly be clearer on changes within Sisu&#8217;s own strategy towards the club. Too many supporters take the easy option of considering Sisu to be a monolithic unchanging behemoth rather than adopt the more subtle approach to them as an organisation with an ever-evolving strategy. The current manifestation of this dates, in my estimation, from a little under two years ago when Joy Sepalla took a more direct role in the running of the football club and appointed Tim Fisher and Steve Waggot to carry this out. Prior to that I think they were floundering under a succession of poor operators from Ray Ransom to Ken Dulieu. I&#8217;d go as far as to say that the current regime, judged purely on football decisions, can hardly be faulted.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The stadium is of course another matter. Even so on matters of due diligence and failure to deal with a crippling rent and revenue agreement all can agree they messed up badly and, by the time Sepalla was in fuller control, this was pretty much unsalvageable by any normal means, particularly since by this time&#8212;and on this I fundamentally disagree with you&#8212;ACL were set on a course of regime change. This is not to condone the actions of Sisu, particularly in moving the club out of the city, but it illustrates my view that a combination of previous owners, the city council and Sisu themselves had created the situation they were in at that moment. But crucially, for future developments, Coventry City Council, not just Sisu, had embarked on its own form of stubborn rejectionism that was to play a key role in the club&#8217;s decline.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Sisu have always maintained that this was about more than the rent and, whilst the spectre of Financial Fair Play regulations may be a slight red herring, they nonetheless have a point. Even so you are totally wrong on your assertion that they have turned down an offer lower than what they currently pay Northampton Town. I assume you refer to an attempt by ACL to amend the terms of the CVA, but the figure mentioned in this regard has never&#8212;to my knowledge&#8212;been offered to the football club. There is a very good case for saying that it should&#8212;it would call Sisu&#8217;s bluff, since they would easily make more revenue from the bigger gates at the Ricoh than they currently do at Sixfields. If it could be arranged on a rolling basis they could even continue to build their own stadium at the same time, if that&#8217;s what they want to do.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The biggest setback of all was probably the failure of the bid to buy the Higgs&#8217; share of the stadium. In all honesty, and contrary to your assertions, no-one knows why that did not succeed. But to say the council had no involvement is naive: they retain the absolute right to veto such a sale and, particularly in the person of the now-deposed John Mutton, gave every indication they intended to use it.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[You dispute descriptions of the stadium as a &#8220;white elephant&#8221;, citing accounts which show a minor loss this year, which could be easily made up by the odd extra event. Others would dispute this, though certainly ACL argue that the stadium can exist as a viable business without the football club. Without entering into that debate what is undeniable is the shear waste of resources that is represented by the existence of a modern, state-of-the-art football stadium standing empty every Saturday afternoon whilst the club it was built for play their &#8220;home&#8221; games 35 miles away. Regardless of any business case this alone is reason enough to label the stadium a pretty large &#8220;white elephant&#8221;.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[My biggest problem with your account though is over the administration itself. Of course it is undeniable that Sisu put the club into administration. Of course they did this in such a way that it would work in their favour. But it was an essentially defensive move in response to the legal moves by ACL. To think that they would have taken this course otherwise is absurd. Incidentally, ACL&#8212;formed by Coventry City Council and with several board members in common&#8212;is hardly a separate entity from the local authority.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[As a fan, the timing of ACL&#8217;s actions firstly to push the club into administration, and secondly to refuse to sign the CVA that would have taken them out again&#8212;accompanied on each occasion by a ten point penalty&#8212;was appalling. Just as the team was looking near-certainties to clinch a play-off spot to be hit by this was heart-breaking. To compound that with another points deduction&#8212;for no positive reason that anyone has yet discovered&#8212;just as Steven Pressley&#8217;s squad served up the most exciting football for a generation truly beggars belief. To maintain that Sisu were technically responsible for administration is kind of like shooting the messenger.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[We are now in a seemingly intractable situation where apportioning the blame for what has happened so far is increasingly futile. Even allowing for the huge element of spin employed by both sides I feel the latest statement from the club, in which they state that there will be no return to the previous landlord/tenant situation, is probably a fair summary of where they are at. I don&#8217;t truly believe they want to build a new stadium&#8212;though I think they will if they have to&#8212;so a return to the Ricoh is the only way forward that makes any sense at all. And if that&#8217;s what the council want then they will have to consider a sale.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I hate that we are in this situation but can see at least one positive. As I said at the outset the Sky Blue Trust has emerged as an organisation truly fit for the role of intervening and playing a crucial and positive role in all this. Normally for me which side to take in the battle between an international hedge fund and a Labour-controlled local authority for a small part of the soul of a community would be a no-brainer. But on this occasion the only side I want to take is that of the supporters who, via the Trust, can drag the other ragged self-interested parties into doing the right thing in spite of themselves.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/article&gt;\n');

It will be something cultural &#8230; a complete rejection of the corrupt and venal values of those who run society.&#8221;]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Much of the left have been more enthusiastic, seeing Brand&#8217;s words as confirmation that a new mood exists amongst the poor and the young who have been on the sharp end of attacks from successive governments. It backs up their argument as well that for many there is barely any difference to be discerned between the principal parties.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I find myself generally sympathetic to Brand. But it&#8217;s a little more complex than his manifesto would suggest.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The first time I exercised my right to vote Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister. This was not my choice. In fact I had to wait eighteen years until placing my &#8220;X&#8221; resulted in my choice of administration. And that process gave us Tony Blair: a Labour leader in name only, leading a party that was, in the words of Peter Mandelson, &#8220;intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich&#8221;. A party that in government proceeded to deepen our enslavement to the paradigm (to use one of Brand&#8217;s favourite words) of the absolute rule of the market. And that gave us, as their lasting legacy, the disastrous adventure in Iraq&#8212;sold on lies and deceit.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Sure they tossed us a few scraps: a minimum wage set pitifully low, and the right to trade union recognition providing the bosses didn&#8217;t put the frighteners on you first.

But fundamentally things went on as before.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[So I understand the appeal of refusing to participate in this version of the democratic process.

And indeed if you are part of the mainstream media that for the most part inhabits pretty much the same space.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Now Brand tells us revolution is coming. My hunch is he&#8217;s a little wayward in that assessment but something is in the air as more and more people come to the realisation that we, as a species, are sleep-walking to disaster.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[I&#8217;m glad Brand has made his intervention. By his own admission he doesn&#8217;t have the answers but frankly neither do the bulk of his critics. Labelling him as naive and his politics as adolescent is patronising to the people to whom he is giving a voice. Just as I was writing this Prime Minister&#8217;s Questions was being broadcast on the radio. I defy anyone to listen to that and tell me Brand is any less grown-up. And these are the people that are really in charge.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[To argue, like Nick Cohen, that Brand is acting as a &#8220;glib exhibitionist&#8221; or, like Joan Smith to condemn him as &#8220;more idiot than savant&#8221; is to betray a deep lack of understanding at just how deeply what he says represents many people&#8217;s thinking.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Nonetheless to justify withdrawal from the whole voting thing and leave it at that is not enough. Indeed it is my view that the argument around whether one chooses to withdraw or engage with that is a red herring. Actually there are still differences between mainstream parties even if their policies don&#8217;t always fully reflect this.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[For all that his opponents have lined up to defend the gains of the parliamentary process there must be a recognition that real change has come from what we do in between those fragments of time that it takes to write an &#8220;X&#8221; in a box. That being organised in a trade union is going to help you stand up to a piss-taking boss more than who you voted for last time for example.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Rather than writing off Russell Brand as an attention-seeking vacuous celebrity his critics should listen a bit more and take note.

The list of banned acts seems to be mostly a checklist of what, in the collective mind of the assorted old Etonians that run the UK, could be considered pure deviance. These include spanking, urination, female ejaculation, face-sitting and fisting.

Of course this certificate itself is pretty arbitrary: a taped together hotch-potch of things that at various times have provoked a negative reaction amongst a combination of the police, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) and the Crown Prosecution Service.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/03/porn-law-amendments-film-board&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/span&gt; Murray Perkins, senior examiner at the BBFC explained that his organisation had two main responsibilities that were being discharged through these regulations: protecting potential viewers of such material from harm and ensuring that no material is made available that would be liable to prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act. Additionally he was clear that no blanket bans were being proposed: everything would be judged in context. Let&#8217;s look at those claims.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[To begin with, let&#8217;s look at the idea that viewing certain material&#8212;the example given is the restriction on breath that may occur during the act of face-sitting&#8212;could be harmful to the viewer. Perkins elaborates that &#8220;breath restriction for the purposes of sexual enjoyment can result in death. Given such a clear and well-documented risk of harm, passing such breath play in a sex work would be contrary to the BBFC&#8217;s designated responsibility&#8221;. Now I&#8212;alongside pretty much everyone else&#8212;do a multitude of things every day that could result in death, from descending the stairs in my house to taking a train to work. All of them have clear and well-documented risks of harm. Just imagine what would be left if all such activites were cut from the average episode of &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;Casualty&lt;/span&gt;. It&#8217;s not going to happen, and nor should it with regard to pornography.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Moving on to the other main responsibility of the BBFC, Perkins suggest a prime example of an activity liable to prosecution would be &#8220;any repeated focus on urination during sex and urination over any other person, including any act which cannot be distinguished from urination on the basis of the onscreen evidence alone&#8221;. Seriously: the depiction of someone pissing&#8212;not even on another person&#8212;is grounds for prosecution. Whether or not that turns you on, it is hard to take seriously the idea that it should be illegal.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[In some ways though the claim of taking account of context is the most pernicious. From the point of view of producers of porn, how will they know in advance what will constitute an acceptable context for their work? Given the arbitrary and subjective way this operates the safest option is to avoid potentially unacceptable subjects altogether. That would represent for many producers working in minority and niche areas of interest a step too far and drive them either out of business, out of the UK, or to produce material that is more in line with the mainstream and which is, frankly, far less interesting within the wide and varied realm of human sexuality.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[But not just that. Much mainstream pornography is&#8212;in many cases rightly&#8212;considered to be deeply misogynist. Conversely many of the activities that are under threat here are precisely those that talk about both pleasure and power from a woman&#8217;s perspective: male ejaculation is fine but the female equivalent (because the BBFC can&#8217;t tell if it&#8217;s actually urination) is not. Causing a woman to gag during oral sex is acceptable but for a woman to sit on a man&#8217;s face is beyond the pale. As erotic film-maker Erika Lust points out in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-new-uk-porn-legislation-will-turn-erotic-film-into-boring-unrealistic-male-fantasy-9898052.html&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;Independent&lt;/span&gt;: &#8220;With this legislation, the UK is in danger of finding itself back in an age where porn is simply the boring, unrealistic, male fantasy of bimbos eagerly pleasing men as if it is their duty, where women are submissive and lack ownership of their sexuality. Women in the industry will now fear the loss of their livelihoods as well as their sexual independence.&#8221;]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[This is a deeply illiberal and reactionary step and potentially paves the way for further far-reaching changes in how our media is produced and consumed.

That&#8217;s what passes for politics today: more about surface than substance, about personality over genuinely held beliefs. It&#8217;s easy to be cynical: no-one has forgotten David Cameron declaring an unlikely penchant for the Smiths during his own appearance.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[So how did Miliband fare?]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Frankly, you could hear the boxes being ticked. Three political songs (from the ANC&#8217;s liberation anthem to Paul Robeson singing the ballad of Joe Hill) kicked us off to remind us of what job he does and who is dad was followed by tracks that evidenced what an ordinary geezer he really is. Or maybe just that he&#8217;s not particularly interested in music. His choices were so cheesy (in his own words)&#8212;taking in a-ha and Robbie Williams&#8212;it&#8217;s hard to decide whether they showed that he&#8217;d made the selections himself rather than them being that of a spin doctor or whether they were the results of some truly brilliant spin, designed to engender sympathy.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Spooky then that it was 17 years to the day that Miliband&#8217;s predecessor but one&#8212;the master of spin himself, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/ca0f2a43#p0093n5f&quot; class=&quot;newWindow&quot;&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;&#8212;appeared on &lt;span class=&quot;namedTitle&quot;&gt;Desert Island Discs&lt;/span&gt; at a roughly similar time in his political journey. In 1996 he was leader of the Labour Party and hoping to be the next prime minister within the year. His choices of music were more diverse than Miliband&#8217;s, taking in the likes of Debussy, Robert Johnson and Springsteen, but what really came across&#8212;and surprisingly, given his reputation today as the ultimate actor-turned-politician&#8212;was that they seemed to be more believably genuine than Ed&#8217;s. Certainly they were considerably better: I wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of that selection myself.]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[It&#8217;s not exactly scientific but maybe the comparison serves to show how much the business of politics has changed in those 17 years.

If, for instance, the future of the movie business comes to rely on the income from Netflix&#8217;s &#36;8-a-month-streaming-service as a way to fund all films and TV production, then things will change very quickly.

Those rates, carried over to the digital age, explain why artists are getting such paltry sums from Spotify.&#8221;]]&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Exactly. Digital reproduction makes the distribution of recorded work unbelievably easy and cheap. That&#8217;s great for the consumer. The owners of the product (the record labels) do OK.

Could that not be taken as a description of all industries? Digitisation of the product and its easy distribution via the internet has been a game-changer. The music industry is suffering but not alone.
