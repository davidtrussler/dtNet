Myself and my partner in Futura Graphics spent a day visiting both restaurants, getting a feel for the ambience of each location and recording this photographically.

		<p>My main challenge was to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface to enable visitors to get the maximum from the site. Whilst browsing the site, visitors can keep a thumbnail reminder of images in which they are interested in a �ightbox�area, as well as viewing full data on each image and freely downloading a low resolution, water-marked version. The site also includes an online payment system to enable users to buy credits which they can use to purchase digital downloads of their chosen images.</p>
