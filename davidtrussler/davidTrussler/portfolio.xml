			<p>The coding presented me with a few challenges: most notably in the layered semi-transparent background at the foot of each page. This was solved with the use of transparent PNGs. These themselves are replaced when the site is rendered on IE6.</p>]]>

This will be extended in future to include a postcode search, once the existing database is updated to include postcode data for items on sale. For sellers, there is the facility to enter all the details of their item and upload pictures. The images are stored on the server and displayed on demand.</p>]]>

			<![CDATA[<p>This site is for a jewellery designer, which I developed from designs from <a href="http://www.rdd-design.com" class="newWindow">RDD Design</a>.</p>
			<p>It is a simple but elegantly-designed site which showcases the designer&#8217;s collection quite effectively through the use of images on the three pages of examples. This works by loading the images in a random order each time the site is visited and then displaying them as thumbnails and an associated main image. A subtle use of Javascript keeps the text on all pages vertically centred.</p>]]>

Once the test is complete, a PHP script calculates the results, based on their answers and then refers them to the appropriate next stage of the insurance process, depending on the outcome. Additionally, I wrote a MySQL database-driven back end to process the responses.</p>]]>

			<![CDATA[<p>This is a demonstration version of a project I carried out for a printing company, currently in commercial use. It is a web-based system which allows the company&#8217;s customers to create their own business cards from a pre-existing template.</p>
			<p>It is centred on a mySQL database using PHP to send XML data into and out of a Flash-based interface. This data is then used, again via PHP, to create an imposed ready-to-print PDF file for the customer. Feel free to try this out. For security reasons, I have changed the company logo and addresses and disabled the payment function so although you can download your own, personalised business card, you will not be invoiced!</p>]]>

			<p>The site is designed to allow images to be uploaded at a high resolution, which are automatically resized to thumbnails which can be browsed by theme or searched according to keywords by visitors to the site.</p>
			<p>My main challenge was to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface to enable visitors to get the maximum from the site. Whilst browsing the site, visitors can keep a thumbnail reminder of images in which they are interested in a &#8216;lightbox&#8217; area, as well as viewing full data on each image and freely downloading a low resolution, water-marked version. The site also includes an online payment system to enable users to buy credits which they can use to purchase digital downloads of their chosen images.</p>
			<p>I designed the look of the site and wrote all the back-end programming to make it function. All I need to do now is upload some decent images!</p>]]>
